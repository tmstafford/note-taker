# Note Taker

## Description 
Note Taker can be used to write, save, and delete notes. The application uses an Express.js back end and saves/retrieves note data from a JSON file. 

The application is deployed live on Heroku: https://stormy-cove-01167.herokuapp.com/.

When users open Note Taker, they are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. On the notes page, they are presented with existing notes in the left-hand column, and an empty field in the right-hand column to enter a new Note Title and Note Text. Users can view previous notes displayed on the left-hand column and click on the previous note title to view the note in the larger right-hand column. Delete any note by clicking on the trash icon next to the note. Users can add new notes by clicking the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page. After adding the Note Title and Note Text, click on the Save icon to save the new note and it will display in the left column with all other notes.
